            <p>
              The UK is committed to net zero by 2050. Transport accounts for a quarter of UK emissions, 
              so we need clean fuel alternatives to oil and diesel.

            <h3>High Demand, Limited Supply</h3>
            <p>
              UK fuel producers need sustainable crop feedstocks to make clean fuels, but supply is limited. 
              This creates strong demand for your cover and break crops.

            <h3>Government Subsidies</h3>
            <p>
              To encourage supply, the government subsidises certified clean-fuel feedstocks through credits. 
              We connect farms to refineries, ensuring compliance so both sides benefit from these subsidies.
